## Methodology
- Built a baseline 6-month revenue forecast using ETS time-series modeling
- Developed a driver-based regression model using marketing spend, pricing, promotions, and seasonality
- Simulated best, base, and worst-case scenarios to quantify upside and downside risk

- Marketing spend and promotions significantly impact revenue outcomes
- Best-case scenario demonstrates meaningful upside with optimized spend and pricing
- Worst-case scenario quantifies downside risk if spend is reduced
- Scenario planning enables informed budgeting and risk management decisions

## Outputs
- Baseline revenue forecast
- Scenario-based revenue projections
- Executive-ready visualizations
